Using the Pytorch to learn how to build a deep learning model step by step. The dataset is MNIST. This is used to record my learning process.

Linear Regression is fitting a straight line to model the linear relationship between input variables and output variables, which is often used in prediction and regression analysis tasks.

Logistic Regression is a binary classification method, which uses the sigmoid function.

Feedforward Regression is an artificial neural network consisting of an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.
